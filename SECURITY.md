# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Email **security@mirafold.com**. Please don't open a public issue for
anything you believe is exploitable — email first, and we'll coordinate
disclosure timing with you.

You'll get an acknowledgment within 7 days. There is no bug bounty; fixes
credit the reporter in release notes unless you'd rather not be named.

## Supported versions

Pre-1.0: the latest published release only.

## What's most worth your attention

The trusted-shell boundary is the interesting attack surface: agent output
must never render, wrap, or intercept the prompt box, the WebSocket,
credentials, or shell-owned affordances (permission prompts, pin UI), and
raw agent HTML must never escape the sandboxed iframe. Anything that lets
model-controlled output cross that line is a vulnerability, and exactly the
kind of report we want.
