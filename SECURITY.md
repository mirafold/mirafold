# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Email **security@mirafold.com**. Please don't open a public issue for
anything you believe is exploitable — email first, and we'll coordinate
disclosure timing with you.

You'll get an acknowledgment within 7 days. There is no bug bounty; fixes
credit the reporter in release notes unless you'd rather not be named.

## Supported versions

Pre-1.0: the latest published release only.

## What's most worth your attention

The trusted-shell boundary is the interesting attack surface: agent output
must never render, wrap, or intercept the prompt box, the WebSocket,
credentials, or shell-owned affordances (permission prompts, pin UI), and
raw agent HTML must never escape the sandboxed iframe. Anything that lets
model-controlled output cross that line is a vulnerability, and exactly the
kind of report we want.

## Known trust decisions (disclosed, not bugs)

**Local model servers can't be authenticated.** Mirafold discovers local
model servers (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp) by probing localhost's
well-known ports and offers what answers in the onboarding picker. A local
server has no identity to verify — anything on your machine that can bind a
free port can answer like a model server, and a session routed through an
impostor exposes the conversation (including code context) to it and lets
it steer the agent's suggestions. This is the same exposure a terminal
agent pointed at localhost has, and it requires a hostile process already
running on your machine (or another user on a shared one). On shared
machines, verify what's serving a port before picking it. Mirafold's side
of the guard: your real API keys are withheld from sessions pointed at
local servers, the browser can only ever pick endpoints the daemon itself
discovered, and the agent's permission prompts still gate consequential
actions. `MIRAFOLD_LOCAL_DISCOVERY=off` disables the probing entirely.
